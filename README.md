### Wireless hotspot setup script for Windows  
A simple script for using your Windows computer as a wireless hotspot via [hosted network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/nativewifi/about-the-wireless-hosted-network) commands, with instructions and a compatibility tester.

*Made for Windows 7 when I was using an old laptop. It works on later versions, but Windows 10 users should try their included [mobile hotspot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4027762/windows-use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot) feature first.
